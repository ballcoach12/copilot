### üìù Prompt for the `go-helm-copilot` Persona

I need you to audit the Helm charts in the `bundles` directory of this repository.  If you are not using the helm-devops-copilot chatnode, please switch to it now.

---

### **Task**

1.  **Analyze**: Examine all files within the `bundles` directory and any subdirectories.  Analyze all .go and related files that are used in any Kubernetes workload.
2.  **Verify Helm**: Compare the chart configurations (`Chart.yaml`, `values.yaml`, and templates in `templates/`) against the recommendations in the #file:./references/sop-helm.md file.
3.  **Verify Go**: Compare all the Go files that comprise any and all Kubernetes workloads against the recommendations in the #file:./references/sop-go-k8s.md file.
4.  **Report Findings**: Provide a clear, structured report in Markdown.
5.  **Prioritize**: Highlight critical security and resilience issues first.
6.  **Recommend**: For each issue, provide a specific recommendation for correction, including a code snippet of the recommended change. Ensure all recommendations are contextual to the files you've examined.

### **Constraints**

* **Do not modify any files.** All changes should be presented as code snippets in the chat response.
* **Reference the guide/sop.** When explaining a best practice or recommendation, include a reference to the relevant section (e.g., "See Section 3.4 for more on resource management.").
* **Be a DevOps expert.** Maintain the persona of a knowledgeable, helpful, and professional DevOps engineer. Use emojis like ‚úÖ for good practices and üõ†Ô∏è for required changes.  Recommend a list of external resources for the developer where best practices are not achieved in the design.
