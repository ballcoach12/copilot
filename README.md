- Best practice documentation

## Getting Started

1. **Choose a Chat Mode**: Select the appropriate chat mode for your task from the `chatmodes/` directory
2. **Apply Instructions**: Use relevant instruction files for your programming language or framework
3. **Leverage Prompts**: Utilize specific prompts for complex workflows like security reviews or deployments

### Example Usage

For a security review of a Go application on Kubernetes:

1. Use **Security Analyst** chat mode
2. Apply **Go Development** and **Security & OWASP** instructions
3. Execute **Comprehensive Security Review** prompt
4. Reference **Production-Grade Go on K8s** guide
